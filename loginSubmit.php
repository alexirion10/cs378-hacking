Dear <?php echo $_POST["IDToken1"] ?>, you've fallen for a rather transparent phishing email sent as part of a final project for CS 378: Ethical Hacking.
</p>
<p>
Since this is <i>Ethical</i> Hacking, we're not storing your password or doing anything evil with it. But, you might want to not trust us and change it anyway.

Sorry about that
